# Leaf_diagnosis
Web application to diagnose illnesses on the leaves of diverse plants
Deep learning-based web application for classifying and detecting leaf diseases in diverse plants. This technology can assist farmers and agricultural researchers 
in obtaining reliable and timely disease diagnosis findings in plants. To determine the likely source of a plant illness, a leaf disease classification system is
applied. It takes a picture of the plant's leaf and then analyses the data using a statistical method based on the accuracy of the model. 
Diseases typically develop in the leaves, fruits, and buds. When a plant becomes sick, the crops and fruits and vegetables may be wasted or damaged. 
These diseases, in addition to being detrimental to the plant, can also contribute to the spread of new infections. It's critical to recognize the disease ahead 
of time and take the appropriate actions to keep it from spreading to other trees. The purpose of this work is to create a system that can detect plant illnesses
by combining image processing with leaf image categorization and suggesting the remedies corresponding to that disease. We're utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network to complete this challenge.
